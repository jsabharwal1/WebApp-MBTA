# WebApp-MBTA by Jai Sabharwal

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a web application that finds the nearest MBTA station based on a user's location input, and provides additional information such as wheelchair accessibility, a map with the location of the nearest MBTA station, and the current weather of the location the user inputted. 
<br>
<br>
The project uses the MBTA API to retrieve MBTA stop information and the OpenWeatherMap API to retreive weather information. Extensions to the basic requirements incude the flask web application used to create a user friendly interface, the map display showing the location of the station, the weather information that is provided with the help of open weather api, the error handling securing the program from wrong entries and the wheelchair accessibility and location information, generated with the help of mbta helper and geolocation APIs.

<br>
The Flask web framework is also used to handle HTTP requests and render HTML templates.

**1. The process**   
Through this project, I learnt a lot about web development and how Flask works. I enjoyed working with the various APIs, and trying to display that data in an aesthetic way using html. I specifically enjoyed seeing how the APIs integrate with each other and how the logic works to return the code inputted into Flask. ChatGPT helped me by explaining the errors I kept receiving throughout the project.

Throughout this project, we were able to learn a lot about the basics of web development and the Flask framework. This project helped us gain a better understanding and comfortability with taking user inputs and integrating multiple APIs, as well as displaying information in a user-friendly format.
